# Package Tools

Here we will list some methods that may be useful during the development of a Jaspion project.

## Haskey

This method is a decorator.
When added to a function that will be used as a handler for FreeSwitch events, it ensures that this function will only process events that have the entered **key**.

| Argument | Type | Required | Default |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:--------|
|    key   |  str |   True   |   N/A   |

#### Example

```python
@app.handle('sofia::register')
@haskey('from-user')
def register(event):
    domain = event['from-host']
    username = event['from-user']
    date = event['Event-Date-Local']

    print(f'[{date}] {username}@{domain} - Registred.')
```

## Filtrate

This method is a decorator.
When added to a function that will be used as a handler for FreeSwitch events, it ensures that this function will only process events that have the entered **key** and that have the **value** associated with that key.

| Argument | Type | Required | Default |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:--------|
|    key   |  str |   True   |   N/A   |
|   value  |  str |   True   |   N/A   |

#### Example

```python
@app.handle('sofia::register')
@filtrate('from-user', '1000')
def register(event):
    domain = event['from-host']
    username = event['from-user']
    date = event['Event-Date-Local']

    print(f'[{date}] {username}@{domain} - Registred.')

```

## AbstractBaseHandler

Abstract Base Bandler is an ABC[ยน][1] for those who want to create more robust handlers for events.


### Where is?

You can use ABC you should import the same from `jaspion.abc`. See an example below.

### Show me the code

```python

from jaspion.abc import AbstractBaseHandler
from jaspion import Jaspion


class SimpleHandler(AbstractBaseHandler):
    def setup(self):
        print('Hello, I am a setup.')

    def handle(self):
        print('event:')
        print(self.event)

    def finish(self):
        print('Finishing the processing.')

app = Jaspion(__name__, host='127.0.0.1',
                        port=8021,
                        password='ClueCon')


app['HEARTBEAT'] = SimpleHandler


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

```

### Understanding the example

First of all let's understand the SimpleHandler class:

- It is a subclass of our ABC AbstractBaseHandler.
- Three methods were implemented: setup, handle and finish.
- the SetUp method is called before starting the event processing and is optional.
- The handle method is mandatory and event processing must be contained in it.
- Similar to the setup method, the finish method serves to finalize event processing and is also an optional method.
- Similar to a dictionary, to add a class to a certain event you should use `app[event] = class`.


### Comments

- The event instance to be processed will always be a dictionary referenced in `self.event`.
- To add more than one handler to a given event, you can use the syntax `app[event].append(class)`.
